## Notes

* Binary variables are encoded as **0** and **1**, where **1** generally indicates the presence of a condition or behavior.
* Ordinal variables represent ordered categories and should be interpreted according to their ranking rather than as continuous measurements.
* BMI, MentHlth, and PhysHlth are numerical variables and may require descriptive statistical analysis before modeling.
* Age, Education, and Income are ordinal categories rather than exact numerical values.
* The target variable (**Diabetes_binary**) is imbalanced because this project intentionally uses the original dataset to preserve the real-world distribution of diabetes cases.
